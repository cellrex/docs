Welcome to CellRex, a user-friendly full stack application built with Python and Streamlit. This application allows you to upload, download, and manage your research data with ease. CellRex is a platform that establishes a link between biological metadata and experimentally generated files.

## Features
CellRex is built as a multipage app with three main pages:

1. Upload: This page allows you to upload data files by dragging and dropping them into a dedicated upload folder on your filesystem or your NAS and filling out a form with relevant information. The template and check features streamline the upload process, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the information provided.

2. Search: This page provides a search mask that you can use to specify search criteria and easily find data files.

3. Dashboard: This page provides insights about your data and helps you manage and organize your data efficiently.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to CellRex! See the repositoryâ€™s [readme.md](https://github.com/cellrex/cellrex/blob/main/readme.md) for instructions on how you can set up the development environment.
